# RaspberryPi and SenseHat Integration

## SenseHat Grid Display
The Sense HAT is a sensor board for the Raspberry Pi that allows users to access a wide range of environmental sensors and control an 8x8 RGB LED matrix. This is great for creating simple animations or displaying information in a unique way. In this README file, we'll explore how the Sense HAT grid works and provide sample code for printing moving text and static patterns on the LED matrix.

## SenseHat Joystick
This project showcases the functionality of the joystick and how it can be used to interact with the Raspberry Pi. With the code provided, you can easily set up your own joystick and experiment with different ways to control your Raspberry Pi.

## SenseHat Sensor
This repository contains a Python script that demonstrates how to use the inbuilt sensors of the SenseHat, a hardware add-on board for the Raspberry Pi computer.

# Execute
To run the script, first make sure that your Raspberry Pi is connected to a SenseHat board. Then, clone this repository and navigate inside the directory which you want to run for an instance let's take `SenseHat_Sensor`. Finally, run the script using the following command:

```
python filename.py
```
